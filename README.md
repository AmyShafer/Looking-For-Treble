# Looking for Treble

If there's one thing the past few years have taught us, it's that friendships and live shows matter to us. Looking for Treble aims to connect local fans through their shared music passions. By just signing up and adding their Spotify account, this modern application lets users find their own Good Treble.

## Technologies

The front-end of this application was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React.

Looking for Treble's back-end was created using Node.js, MySql, Express, NPM, and JavaScript.

Additionally, the application used Spotify's API, TicketMaster's API, and the authentication was powered by OAuth2.

## Resources Used

The Spotify documentation helped developers navigate adding the API to the application
[Spotify Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

Developers consulted Auth0's documentation for connecting users' Spotify account to Good Treble's back-end.  
[Auth0 Documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api)

[Boostrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/) helped this project slap!

[This page](https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#common-system-errors) was used when the group faced with Node.JS errors within the sign-up/log-in form.

## Future Improvements

In the future, Looking for Treble would like to add a way for users to message each other. This hope is this would help users meet up at live shows IRL and get the word out about smaller musical acts that are not yet on Spotify.
