# Good Treble

If there's one thing the past few years have taught us, it's that friendships and live shows matter to us. Good Treble aims to connect local fans through their shared music passions. By just signing up and addding their Spotify account, this modern application lets users start their own Good Treble.

## Technologies

The front-end of this application were built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Handlebars.

Good Treble's back-end was created using Node.js, MySql, Express, NPM, and JavaScript.

Additionally, the application used Spotify's API with authentication powered by OAuth2.
